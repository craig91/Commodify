Some referred such taste to the nature of the soil in such areas, others returned it to the nature of Sidr trees, and some mentioned that such distinctive taste comes as a result of the fact that bees have to travel several miles (maybe hundreds in round trip) to extract the nectar from the Sidr tree.
